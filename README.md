**Unnode.js** is a framework that makes creating Node.js back ends easy. It provides you with **process clustering**, **proper logging**, **web backend abstraction** and **vhosts** (domain-based routing). It's small, simple and doesn't force you into a strict framework-structure; you can still organize your project as you like.

**It is** a  *bare-bones framework for creating hand-crafted custom back ends where speed and precision are of the essence*.
